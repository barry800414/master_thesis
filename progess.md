Todo:
2. Should compare the results if using K-Means algorithm
    **see README.md in ./classifier folder 
    Should run: 
      1.DFM.py: Direct feature merging (using community detection)
      2.FM.py: two-side feature merging (using community detection)
      3.DFM_KMeans: Direct feature merging (using K-Means)
      4.FM_KMeans.py: two-side feature merging (using K-Means)

    on features:
      1. each single features
      2. merged features

    To compare: 
      1. DFM & DFM_KMeans  
      2. FM & FM_KMeans

    * to ask Hou how to deploy tasks to other clusters

3. Should investigate the sensitivity of threshold selection in community detection
    **see README.md in ./ResultAnalysis folder
    Should run:
      1. PlotThreshold.py: convert data to excel friendly format
      2. ResultStat.py: calculating statistics about the result
    
4. Should inverstigate the physical meaning when merging features
